<h1>The Best Movies According to Tim</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr>
<h3>The Fifth Element(1997)</h3>
<p>A must watch! One crazy, action packed,sci-fi/romance movie. Starring Bruce Willis, Milla Jovovich, and Chris Tucker. 
</p>
<h3>Moulin Rouge(2001)</h3>
<p>This movie is a true classic and love it. This movie is a dramatic musical, filled with the highs and lows of love. This movie is starred by Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman. I challenge anyone to not cry after watching this epic.
 </p>
<h3>The Terminator(1984)</h3>
<p>This movie is absolutely brilliant and blew my mind along with many others as a child. This is another action packed sci-fi movie, but with killer future robots and Arnold Schwarzenegger. Another must watch if you are a movie connoisseur! </p>
